# db_module
The db_module.py defines a reusable Database class for interacting with a PostgreSQL database in Python. This class provides essential database management operations, including:
- Connecting to PostgreSQL using specified parameters.
- Creating tables with dynamic schemas.
- Fetching all table names.
- Deleting specific tables by name.
- Deleting entire databases securely by connecting to a default database.
- Closing connections gracefully to avoid resource leaks.
